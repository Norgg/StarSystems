Scientists have noted a particular burning sensation and potential loss of vision if it is stared at for long periods of time. This is especially important to keep in mind considering the effect shiny objects have on the average Kerbal.

					BodyDescription = This white dwarf is much more dense than Kerbol. Kerbal astronomers theorize that it used to look like Kerbol long ago, but it eventually shrunk down into its current size when it ran out of fuel. Some of its old planets may still orbit the ghost star. Be careful though, they could be haunted.
