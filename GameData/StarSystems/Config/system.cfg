					BodyDescription = This white dwarf is much more dense than Kerbol. Kerbal astronomers theorize that it used to look like Kerbol long ago, but it eventually shrunk down into its current size when it ran out of fuel. Some of its old planets may still orbit the ghost star. Be careful though, they could be haunted.
