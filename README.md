StarSystems
===========
Ksp MOd for solar system creator

This is the third fork of this project. This mod is intended to compliment mods such as Planet Factory by adding the ability to create a galactic scale kerbal universe and to hack around the game's limitation that limits it to a single working star. 

It would be nice if either of the previous maintaners could accept these changes and re-merge everything back.
